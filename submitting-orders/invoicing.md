# Invoicing and accepted payment options
Have questions about invoicing or payment options, you will find the answer here.

### Accepted methods of payment ###
AISLER uses **Mollie**, a Dutch payment service provider, trusted by many webshops.

We support the following payment types:

- Paypal
- Creditcard
- Bank transfer
- Bitcoin
- iDeal 
- KBC/CBC, Belfius, and Bancontact
- Sofort Überweisung

Everytime you use the **Pay Now** functionality on AISLER, you will be redirected to a page on Mollie that allows you to select your favorite payment type. After you successfully went through the payment process you will be redirected to one of AISLER's pages.

AISLER only accepts pre-payment. We will send your order only once we have received your payment. All methods other than Bank Transfer ensure that you receive your order directly after we have made it ready for shipment. You will be able to download your invoice after you have placed your order.  
 

### Invoicing for businesses based in the in the EU ###
Are you a business in the EU and want to take advantage of the EU reverse charge regulation? No problem, we are based in the Netherlands, which means every business inside a member state of the European Union is eligible for a VAT-free invoice according to EU reverse charge regulations. This does not apply a) when you ship to the Netherlands, or b) are a Dutch entity. In that case you can deduct the VAT with your quarterly declaration. 

Please contact us via [felix@aisler.net](mailto:felix@aisler.net), send your valid Tax-Id and we will gladly set your account to a VAT-free account. When you are logged in and eligible for VAT-free, you will then see prices without VAT and your invoice will be VAT-free. Please note that you still have to abide to local tax laws. 

For addresses outside the European Union we automatically deduct the VAT so no registration is necessary.
