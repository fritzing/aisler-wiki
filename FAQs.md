### Who is behind AISLER? ###

AISLER was born out of the Euregio Maker Scene in Aachen, Germany. We started it because we wanted to support authors who provide great documentation for great projects but do not want to take the risks to organize the components for other makers. We are proud makers ourselves and want to enable everyone to be a maker! AISLER was co-founded by Patrick and Felix, for more info head over to the Team section.

### Where are the circuit boards made? ###

We have partnered with a manufacturer from Germany that produces boards for the car industry, medical device industry and other industrial grade applications, and, well now also for us :-) We are extremely proud that any author can now benefit from their board manufacturing quality – Made in Germany.
 
### How are the circuit board's production parameters and which technologies do you support? ###

Your boards will all come with green soldermask, white top and bottom legend, and will have ENIG surface plating. We only use high-class FR4, 1.6mm TG150 material. We currently limit the offering to two-layer boards with 35µm copper weight. If you need more copper or want to have 4-layer boards please join our Beta-List by sending us an email to support@aisler.net.

### You say you are affordable, how much do you charge? ###

We have tried to make our pricing as transparent as possible. For a simple pricing overview feel free to use our calculator. If you find a price for a batch of three PCBs somewhere else that is more affordable, we guarantee to match that price. Just send us an email to [felix@aisler.net](mailto:felix@aisler.net)


### You talked about assembly, how can I try it? ###

Currently affordable assembly is in closed beta. If you want to join, please let us know via support@aisler.net.

### What are the design rules for the PCBs? ###

The following design rules should be respected if you like to manufacture your PCBs with us.

- Min. trace width: 100 μm
- Min. trace spacing: 100 μm
- Min. pitch between traces: 200 μm
- Spacing PCB edge to trace: 200 μm
- Spacing via to via: 0.30 mm
- Spacing drill to drill: 0.15 mm
- Min. drill diameter for vias: 0.2 mm
- Min. via pad diameter: Via drill + 0.25 mm
- Min. stroke width of legend print: 100 μm
 
### What file extensions should my Gerber files have? ###

We accept quite a lot of file extensions, but to make sure everything gets detected correctly you should use these extensions:

<table>
<tr><th>Gerber Layer Name</th><th>Layer</th></tr>
<tr> <td>project_name.toplayer.ger</td><td>Top Layer</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>project_name.bottomlayer.ger</td><td>Bottom Layer</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>project_name.topsoldermask.ger</td><td>Top Soldermask</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>project_name.bottomsoldermask.ger</td><td>Bottom Soldermask</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>project_name.topsilkscreen.ger</td><td>Top Silkscreen</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>project_name.bottomsilkscreen.ger</td><td>Bottom Silkscreen</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>project_name.boardoutline.ger</td><td>Board Outline</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>project_name.xln</td><td>PTH Drills</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>project_name_npth.xln</td><td>NPTH Holes</td> </tr>
</table>

**Please note:** Upload all your Gerbers in one ZIP-File for us to automatically detect your project's parameters. Also, please remove all unnecessary files in the zip folder.

### I’m a business and would like to receive an invoice without VAT ###

We are based in the Netherlands, which means every business inside a member state of the European Union is eligible for a VAT-free invoice according to EU reverse charge regulations. Please contact us via [felix@aisler.net](mailto:felix@aisler.net), send your valid Tax-Id and we will gladly set your account to a VAT-free account. When you are logged in, you will then see prices without VAT and your invoice will be VAT-free. Please note that you still have to abide to local tax laws. For addresses outside the European Union we automatically deduct the VAT so no registration is necessary.

### Do you charge for shipping? ###

Yes and No. We will send boards for free through regular mail when the order is higher than 30 EUR. If you prefer them to be shipped as insured mail you can select as an option during your order. We know shipping works smoothly in Europe & US. Want to receive your Kit in other countries, please send us an email at [felix@aisler.net](mailto:felix@aisler.net) or contact us through our social media accounts.

### Do you ship world-wide? ###

Yes, we currently have good experience with shipping to countries in the European Union, United States and Canada. All other countries are possible, but we don't guarantee a delivery time. 

### What is the lead time for the production? ###

Regular 2-Layer circuit board orders will be shipped to you within 12 business days or less. We will update on the progress of the production and if any problems arise that could extend that timeline.

### What methods of payment do you accept? ###

We currently accept wire transfer, major credit cards, Bitcoin and Paypal. All transfers are handled securely through our payment provider **Mollie**.
